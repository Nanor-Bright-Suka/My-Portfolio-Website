                      I am an aspiring frontend developer with a strong passion for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. I have gained knowledge in modern technologies such as React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and React Router, and Iâ€™m continuously expanding my understanding to stay current with industry trends.

                        Driven by curiosity and a deep desire to solve complex problems, I enjoy the challenge of learning new frontend technologies and applying them to real-world projects. My goal is to become a versatile developer, capable of creating intuitive and visually appealing web applications that enhance user experience.
